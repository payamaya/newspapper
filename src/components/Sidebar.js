          If you have a problem if no one else can help and if you can find them
          maybe you can hire The A-Team. Here's the story of a lovely lady who
          was bringing up three very lovely girls. And we'll do it our way yes
          our way. Make all our dreams come true for me and you. Michael Knight
          a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent. The
          helpless. The powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the
          law. Makin' your way in the world today takes everything you've got.
          Takin' a break from all your worries sure would help a lot. Just two
          good ol' boys Wouldn't change if they could. Fightin' the system like
          a true modern day Robin Hood. Believe it or not I'm walking on air. I
          never thought I could feel so free. Flying away on a wing and a
          prayer. Who could it be? Believe it or not its just me. Now were up in
          the big leagues getting' our turn at bat.
